Predicting whether a stock market index will go up or down the following day based on historical data, and how that is impacted by posts on social media platforms—specifically Twitter—over the same span of time. 

A study of various machine learning techniques.
We included Bayesian/GMM learning, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and a manually implemented Neural Network with backpropagation. 
For the stock market index portion, the dataset consisted of historical stock market data, and the target variable is a binary label indicating whether the index increased (1) or decreased (0) the next day. 

We compared the performance of these machine learning methods in capturing patterns in stock market data for binary classification and the impact social media can have on stock market predictions. 

The dataset used is from Kaggle, consisting of Twitter data. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/tweets-and-user-engagement
